# Services
A service is an independent part of the Jamout platform. Services should do all or most of the following:
	- Export helper functions for GraphQL queries and mutations.
	- Register as SQS consumers.
	- Manage its own models.
	- Publish events to GraphQL subscriptions.
	- Publish messages to SNS.

Best practices and stuffs for service-to-service communication:
	- Services are NOT aware of each other when it comes to business logic. E.g.; the `chat` service is not aware that there is a `bot` service and vice-versa. Instead, they react to  messages that the other publishes.
	
	Any important attributes should be published with the message itself, but if up to date data or entire objects are needed itâ€™s okay for services to query each other.

	- It might be tempting when building the first iterations of services, but services should NEVER access the models of another service.
	- Permission checks should be done before a message is published.

#### Service List:
	1. `iam` 
		- User accounts and profiles
		- Roadmap: user groups + permission policies
	2. `chat`
		- Channels, Subscriptions, and Messages
		- Not concerned with bot logic or NLP
	3. `bot`
		- NLP via API.ai
	4. `onboarding`???
	5. `Distribution`
