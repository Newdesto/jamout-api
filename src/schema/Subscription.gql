  # Trusting an anonymous ID argument poses a security risk.
  # If you get a hold of an anonymous ID you can pass it to the GQL server
  # and receive the messages related to it. A possible solution is to generate
  # an anonymous JWT to derive the anonymous ID from. Though, if you can get a
  # hold of the anonymous ID you can probably get a hold of the anonymous JWT.
