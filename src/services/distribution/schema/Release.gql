# We store ReleaseEvents instead of Releases to have an audit log and to
# be able to replay or undo events. Some events include:
#   1. Release a track/album several times, each time with different properties - such
#      such as channels, metadata, etc.
#   2. Update an existing track/album only on a specific channel. E.g.; updating
#      the description for a track on SoundCloud.
#   3. Delete an existing track/album from a specific channel. E.g.; deleting the 
#      content from Spotify.
